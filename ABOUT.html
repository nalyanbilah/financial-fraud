              <h3>Bank Negara Malaysia for Financial Scams</h3>
              <p>Any money-related matters are governed by them and this includes investigating financial scams as well. Apart from filing a report with PDRM, BNM should be the next authority you contact if you’ve been scammed. They might be able to trace where your money has gone, and if they’re successful, they may be able to get your money back. To file a complaint with BNM, you can call their BNMTELELINK, which is <br> 1-300-88-5465 (1-300-88-LINK). </p>

              <h3>MCMC for Cyber Scams</h3>
              <p>While scams mostly involve stealing people’s money, they can also come in other forms. Sometimes, they might even trick you into giving out your personal information. Scammers can call you, leave you texts or even send you suspicious links that steal your data. For scams like these, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) would be the one to investigate them. MCMC does a lot of things, from regulating content that goes up on the internet to putting out rules for media companies to follow. Dealing with scams would also come under their purview. </p>
